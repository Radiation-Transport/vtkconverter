# VTK Converter

The tool is a Python 3.6 based package that can analize, modify and convert VTK responses
to suitable formats for subsequent analyses.
The tool is used through a text based interactive menu, and it can be run under Windows
or Linux systems. It requires the use of python 3.6 or a higher version.

## Installation

The user can download this project from the main folder that contains the setup.py file the 
package can be installed via pip:
> pip install .

This should install all the dependencies and make the tool ready to use in the environment 
where it was installed.

## How to use

Once installed the tool can be started by executing the command:
> python -m vtkconverter

Then the command line interface will start-up and prompt the user with several commands like
open a VTK file, print some information of a mesh and write it in another format.

## Version
